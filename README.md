## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18.0.0 or higher
- **npm** 9.0.0 or higher (or yarn/pnpm equivalent)
- **Mapbox Access Token** - Required for map rendering ([Get one here](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/))

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IsAAcEdj/Climate-Resilience---Miami-Dade.git
cd Climate-Resilience---Miami-Dade
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Mapbox Token

Open `src/App.jsx` and locate the Mapbox access token configuration:

```javascript
mapboxgl.accessToken = 'YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN';
```

Replace `YOUR_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN` with your actual Mapbox access token.

**Note**: For production deployments, consider using environment variables to securely manage your access token.

### 4. Verify Installation

```bash
npm run dev
```

The development server should start, and you'll see output indicating the local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Development

### Running the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command:
- Starts the Vite development server
- Enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates
- Opens the application in your default browser (or displays the URL)

The server will automatically reload when you make changes to the code.

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates an optimized production build in the `dist/` directory with:
- Minified JavaScript and CSS
- Optimized asset bundling
- Tree-shaking for smaller bundle sizes

### Previewing Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

Preview the production build locally before deploying to ensure everything works correctly.

### Development Workflow

1. Make changes to source files in `src/`
2. The development server automatically reloads on save
3. Test your changes in the browser
4. Run tests to ensure functionality: `npm test`
5. Build for production when ready: `npm run build`

## Features in Detail

### Search Functionality

The search system provides intelligent, multi-field searching across all project attributes:

**Searchable Fields:**
- Project name
- City/location
- Infrastructure type
- Project description
- Categories
- Disaster focus

**Features:**
- Case-insensitive matching
- Partial word matching
- Relevance scoring (exact matches ranked higher)
- Real-time results (updates as you type)
- Keyword highlighting in results
- Keyboard navigation support
- Results limited to top 10 most relevant matches

**Usage:**
1. Click or focus on the search bar at the top of the map
2. Type your search query
3. Results appear in a dropdown below the search bar
4. Use arrow keys to navigate, Enter to select, Escape to close
5. Click any result to navigate to that project on the map

### Filtering System

The sidebar provides multiple filtering options that work together:

**Filter Types:**
- **Infrastructure Type**: Green, Blue, Gray, or Hybrid infrastructure
- **Category**: Project categories (e.g., Green Infrastructure, Planning & Assessments)
- **Disaster Focus**: Flooding, Sea Level Rise, Multi-hazard, etc.
- **City**: Filter by specific city or district within Miami-Dade County

**How It Works:**
- Filters are applied in combination (AND logic)
- Markers are dynamically shown/hidden based on active filters
- Active popups for filtered-out projects are automatically closed
- Filter state persists until manually changed

### Map Interactions

**Marker Interactions:**
- Click markers to open detailed project popups
- Hover over markers for visual feedback
- Markers are color-coded by infrastructure type
- Hidden markers (via filters) are automatically managed

**Map Controls:**
- Pan by clicking and dragging
- Zoom with mouse wheel or pinch gestures
- Click outside popups to close them
- Use district navigation to quickly jump to specific areas

**Census Layer:**
- Toggle between Risk Index, Resilience Index, or no layer
- Click census tracts to view detailed risk information
- Hover to see tract statistics
- Layer visibility can be toggled on/off

### Project Popups

Each project popup displays:
- Project name
- Infrastructure type
- Category
- Disaster focus
- City/location
- Project status (with color coding)
- Estimated project cost (formatted)
- Project description (when available)

Popups are positioned dynamically and can be closed by:
- Clicking the close button
- Clicking outside the popup
- Pressing Escape (when search is not active)

## Configuration

### Mapbox Token

The Mapbox access token is configured in `src/App.jsx`:

```javascript
mapboxgl.accessToken = 'pk.eyJ1IjoieW91cnVzZXJuYW1lIiwiYSI6ImNs...';
```

**Security Best Practices:**
- Never commit access tokens to version control
- Use environment variables in production
- Restrict token permissions in Mapbox account settings
- Rotate tokens regularly

### Environment Variables (Recommended)

For production deployments, use environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file:
```bash
VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

2. Update `src/App.jsx`:
```javascript
mapboxgl.accessToken = import.meta.env.VITE_MAPBOX_TOKEN;
```

3. Add `.env` to `.gitignore`

### Customization

**Styling:**
- Global styles: `src/index.css`
- Component styles: Inline styles in `src/App.jsx`
- Map styles: Configured via Mapbox style URLs

**Sidebar Width:**
- Default: 350px
- Location: `src/App.jsx` (search for `width: '350px'`)

**Popup Content:**
- Customize in `MapboxPopup` component in `src/App.jsx`
- Modify `createPopupContent` function for different layouts

## Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
